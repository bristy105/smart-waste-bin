## How It avoids obstacles
<br>
  The basic principle behind the waste bin working through a condition when <br> the ultrasonic sensor gives distance level is less than 15 cm <br>and laser sensor is less than 10 cm (that means waste-bin is kind of filled),<br> Here, is use two conditions for the differenet sensors in the workflow. <br> It sends mail to authority(in this case, it sends mail to our mail address). <br> And that is how authority get notified about if the trash-can is filled or emptied.<br> When it is filled, it gets notification and then authority will empty the bin.the  ultrasonic sensor measured the distance  <br>
